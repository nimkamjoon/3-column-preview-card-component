## Overview

This was my first time building with a mobile-first approach, and also the first time I was able to make a layout that is (properly) responsive. All in all, this project was great practice for the basics of HTML and CSS, and I've definitely picked up on a a few new concepts while working on it. 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements
